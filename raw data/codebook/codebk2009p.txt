GENERAL INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This codebook describes the contents of the panel data set based on
the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and a re-interview with
eligible respondents in that survey in 2009.  The material below
provides basic technical information on the survey and points to more
detail available elsewhere.  The variables included in the internal
version of the data are listed after that in the order in which the
information was obtained in the 2009 interview.  In the public version
of the data set, some of these variables may be omittied or
systematically altered for purposes of disclosure reduction; where
such restrictions have been applied, a note associated with the
variable describes the action taken.

In 2009, the Federal Reserve Board sponsored a re-interview with the
participants in the 2007 SCF.  This panel interview had not been
anticipated when the 2007 survey was conducted.  The re-interview was
motivated by a desire to understand more deeply the effects of the
financial crisis at that time on the U.S. households.  Interviews for
the 2009 survey were largely completed between July and December of
2009, but a small number were finished in the following January.  As
was the case for the 2007 survey, the 2009 data were collected by NORC
at the University of Chicago.

To make the panel interview manageable, the level of detail was
reduced below that of the 2007 survey.  For example, where the 2007
questionnaire asked for details about individual savings accounts, the
panel questionnaire asked only about the total amount and some
characteristics of the accounts.  This change was made both to make
the interview shorter and to facilitate faster processing of the
data.  Every effort was made to sequence and frame the topics in the
panel interview in as parallel a way as possible to the 2007 SCF.
This feature of the questionnaire should tend to reduce incomparabilities
in the two sets of data.  Where there are important differences
between the approaches taken in 2007 and 2009, a note has been added
to the codebook to explain the differences.  Users who wish to
understand potential differences at a deeper level are encouraged to
compare the questions asked in 2009 with those asked in 2007, as given
in the codebook for the 2007 survey:
http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/2007_codebk2007.txt.

To support data quality for a set of critical items in the 2009
interview, three sets of information from the 2007 data were used by
the CAPI (computer assisted personal interviewing) program used to
drive the panel interview: the date of the 2007 interview, measures
of homeownership status, and an indicator for ownership of an actively
managed business.  No other information was brought forward from the
2007 interview, other than the specific information needed to identify
the correct respondent.

For purposes of data editing and other processing, a version of the
2007 data set was constructed that had information at or aggregated to
the same level of detail as the panel.  A version of the SAS program
used to create this file is available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/createpanel.zip
The version of the data made available to the public is based on this
data set.  For the variables included, the variables constructed from
2007 data have a prefix of "X" and the variables obtained from the
panel interview have a prefix of "P".  The text "(QUESTION TEXT) SAME
AS 2009 VERSION" for an X-variable indicates that the 2007 variable is
defined comparably to the 2009 variable; the text "GENERATED FROM 2007
INDIVIDUAL VALUES" indicates that potentially multiple values were
summed or evaluated to determine the value of an X-variable that is
as comparable as possible to the P-variable.

A shadow variable, provided for each main variable, contains
information about the status (complete response, "don't know"
response, refused response, range response, etc.) of the information
included in the variable.  The codes used for this set of variables
are described in more detail below.  The shadow variables for the 2007
variables have a prefix of "J" followed by the numeric part of the
X-name of the variable; for the panel variables, the corresponding
shadow variable prefix is "K".

The panel data were edited using information from both the 2007 and
2009 interviews.  For each interview, supplemental information was
available from comments recorded during the interview by the
interviewer, verbatim responses from respondents, and the information
provided by the interviewer in a mandatory debriefing questionnaire.
Where possible, that information was used to correct errors in the
data and to identify anomalies for further research.  In a number of
cases, the respondent was recontacted to obtain further information
about otherwise irreconcilable discrepancies.  In some cases,
previously undetected errors were uncovered in the 2007 data and those
errors were addressed in the further processing of the data.  Those
changes to the 2007 data have also been incorporated into the full
2007 data set; a version of this corrected data set will be made
available to the public as a supplement to the version not containing
such corrections.

As is the case in most surveys, missing data were a problem in the
panel as well as in the original cross-sectional data.  To maximize the
concordance of data from the two years, missing data in the variables
constructed from the 2007 data were re-imputed along with the
imputation of missing values in the 2009 data.  For more information
on the panel imputation, please see "Look Again: Editing and
Imputation of SCF Panel Data" (Kennickell,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/ASA2011.1.pdf, 2011).

Note that there are some variables in the 2009 survey that do not have
a counterpart in the 2007 survey, and there are some variables from
the 2007 survey that are included in the panel data set even though
they do not have a counterpart in the 2009 questionnaire.  Users who
wish to add further information from the 2007 survey may match such
information from the full cross-sectional version of the 2007 data
using the YY1 ID number that is common to both the panel data set and
the full 2007 cross section.  Users should beware, however, that
because the 2007 part of the panel data set was re-imputed, values
computed from the cross-sectional and panel versions of the same cases
may not always agree.

Ideally, the panel would have followed individually every person
included in each of the 4,422 survey households interviewed in 2007.
Limitations imposed by the available time and money required a more
restricted focus.  Eligibility for inclusion of a household in 2009
was determined by the rules listed below.

1. If the 2007 respondent was alive and not living permanently outside
   the U.S, the target household in 2009 was the one that contained
   that person.
2. Otherwise, if the 2007 respondent was either deceased or living
   permanently outside the U.S. and if the 2007 respondent had a
   spouse or partner who was a part of the PEU as defined in the 2007
   survey, the target household in 2009 was the one that contained the
   2007 spouse or partner of the 2007 respondent, if that spouse or
   partner was still living and residing permanently in the U.S.
3. Otherwise (where (a) the 2007 respondent was either deceased or
   living permanently outside the U.S. in 2009 and (b) either (i)
   there was no spouse or partner who was a part of the 2007 primary
   economic unit or (ii) there was such a spouse or partner but that
   person was either deceased or living permanently outside the U.S.),
   the case was considered to be out of scope for the 2009 survey.

The respondent for the 2009 survey would be either the 2007 respondent
or spouse identified in (1) or (2) above, or that person's spouse or
partner, if that person was more knowledgeable about the household
finances.  Note that where a couple had dissolved during the interval
between the two surveys, only one of the households (generally, the
one of the person who answered the survey questions in 2007) was
pursued.

About 89 percent (3,862) of the eligible households agreed to
complete a panel interview in 2009.  There was little variation in the
response rate across a variety of demographic and economic groups.
Because the SCF combines two samples, one of which over-samples
relatively wealthy households, use of weights is important for
obtaining unbiased population estimates from the data.
Nonresponse-adjusted weights for the panel interviews (P42001) were
constructed using a methodology comparable to that used for the original
2007 weights.  For additional information on the weights, see "Try,
Try Again: Response and Nonresponse in the 2009 SCF Panel" (Kennickell,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/ASA2010final.pdf,
2010).

For a descriptive review of the panel data see "Surveying the
Aftermath of the Storm: Changes in Family Finances from 2007 to 2009"
Jesse Bricker, Brian Bucks, Arthur Kennickell, Traci Mach, and Kevin
Moore, http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201117/201117pap.pdf,
2011).  For further general technical information about the SCF and
the 2007 survey in particular, please see the codebook for that survey
(http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/2007_codebk2007.txt).

The primary economic unit (PEU) is the frame of reference for most of
the information collected in the interview.  The 2007 PEU was defined
as the core individual or core couple in a household (in decreasing
order of preference: the head of the household, the single or couple
owner/renter of the housing unit, or the person aged closest to 45,
plus the person's spouse or patner (if any)) and any minor children
or other people financially interdependent with the core individual
or couple.  The 2007 PEU was identified by the answers to the
questions in the household listing.  For the 2009 panel interview, the
unit is defined similarly as those people in the household who were
financially interdependent with the respondent or that person's spouse
or partner (if any).

DISCLOSURE REVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables not included in the public data set are available only to
the project staff working on the SCF.  Not even other researchers at
the Federal Reserve Board are allowed access to the non-public data.
There is no provision whatsoever for allowing direct access to such
information for external researchers.  Occasionally, when a researcher
outside of the SCF project staff has a topic that complements the
research interest of the Federal Reserve Board and when there has been
time for the project staff to engage with the researcher, the project
staff have made limited runs against the internal data of computer
programs that have been specified and fully tested by external
researchers.  A special case must be made for each such instance.
THERE IS NO ROUTINE PROVISION FOR ACCESS TO THE RESTRICED SCF DATA.

A paramount goal of the survey is to protect the privacy of the
participants, who generously shared their personal information.
In light of this goal, the data in this release have been
systematically altered by several means to minimize the possibility of
identifying any survey respondent.  For some discrete variables, small
or unusual cells were collapsed as noted in the individual variable
descriptions below with the descriptions of the variables.  Continuous
variables were rounded.  Data were also blurred by other means
intentionally not specified.  In addition, a number of other cases
were identified for more extensive treatment.  Some of these cases
were selected on the basis of extreme or unusual data values; other
cases were selected at random.  For each of these cases, a selection
of critical variables was set to missing and statistically imputed
subject to constraints designed to ensure that any distortions induced
in key population statistics would be minimal.  Where relevant, the
codebook provides more detailed information on cell collapsing and
other such techniques.  Unless explicitly noted otherwise, any
disclosure-related changes to the data noted in the descriptions of
the individual variables applies equally to the 2007 and the 2009
data.

By design, the SCF sample excludes people who are included in the
Forbes Magazine list of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S.
However, there are several reasons why respondents with wealth at this
level could appear in the sample anyway.  In the 2007 survey, there
were 4 observations that had net worth at least equal to the minumum
level needed to qualify for the Forbes list; all of these were
re-interviewed in the 2009 panel.  Because it would be very difficult
to obscure sufficiently the identity of such people without rendering
their data virtually useless, it was decided to remove them from the
public version of the datset.  In the 2009 survey, another
observation was removed for the same reason.  Thus, the public version
of the panel data set contains 3,857 of the 3,862 observations in the
full panel data set.

It is important to note that aside from the cell collapsing, there is
no key in this codebook or in the data set that would allow users to
identify with certainty either which data items have been smoothed or
otherwise altered, or which cases were selected for imputation of
critical values (that is, the shadow variables in this data set may not
always reflect the true original status of every variable).  Although
this blurring of the data will have some effect on analysis, that
effect should be negligible in most cases.  For further details
on the procedures taken to protect the identity of respondents, see
"Analyzing the Disclosure Review Procedures for the 1995 Survey of
Consumer Finances," Gerhard Fries, Barry W. Johnson, and R. Louise
Woodburn, September 1997, http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/
scf/scf_workingpapers.htm) and "Multiple Impution and Disclosure
Protection: The Case of the 1995 SCF" (Arthur B. Kennickell, November
1997, http://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf/scf_workingpapers.htm).
The disclosure protections applied to the data are the product of an
agreement between the Federal Reserve Board, NORC, and SOI.  Users who
feel that the restrictions imposed on the public data set are too
constaining are encouraged to submit written proposals for expanded
data release, and those requests will be given serious consideration
in the release of data from future surveys.

The panel data set contains both data newly collected in 2009 and data
constructed from the 2007 baseline data.  Because the full range of
disclosure reduction techniques has been applied to all the variables
in the panel data set, the values of the constructed variables
included may differ from those a user might obtain from the 2007
data.

Note that dollar variables in the public data set have been rounded
according to the following scheme which preserves the population mean
on average:

SHADOW VARIABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhat different conventions were followed in computing the shadow
variables for the main 2007 cross-sectional and the 2009 panel variables
included in the combined data set.  For each panel variable, the shadow
variable directly reflects information about the original status of
the variable, except in the public data set where the value may have
been altered as a result of the disclosure review for the release of
the data.  Treatment of the shadow variables for the 2007 data was
only slightly more complicated.

The following rules applied in constructing the shadow variables for
the main variables constructed or otherwise carried over from the
2007 cross-sectional data:

1. If a variable is not dollar-denominated and it is a direct
   appropriation of a 2007 cross-sectional value, retain the J-code
   value for the 2007 variable.

2. If a variable is not dollar-denominated and it is constructed using
   more than one 2007 variable, all of which are non-missing, assign a
   J-code of 8.

3. If a variable is not dollar-denominated and it is constructed using
   more than one 2007 variable (less than all/all) of which are
   missing, assign a J-code of (2081/2082).

4. If a dollar-denominated panel variable is calculated based on
   only one value for a particular case, retain the 2007 J-code of
   the relevant 2007 variable.
   (This includes both situations where the panel-equivalent variable for
   2007 is defined in terms of a single variable, as well as situations
   where the variable is defined in terms of multiple variables but for
   an individual case only one of those variables is relevant.)

5. If a dollar-denominated variable is calculated from more then one
   variable for an individual case, use the J-code definitions below:

   0       Good reported or edited/moved value
   1       Inapplicable
   1041    Positive range data: UB and LB available
   1042    Positive range data: UB available, LB missing
   1043    Positive range data: UB missing, LB available
   1091    Negative range data: UB and LB available
   1092    Negative range data: UB available, LB missing
   1093    Negative range data: UB missing, LB available
   2052    All missing data, and not known whether item exists
   3600    All missing data, but item known to exist

   Note that a range may be required when any part of the variables
   used in the sum of 2007 values was originally given as any type of
   range or where only a subset of the relevant 2007 variables was not
   entirely missing.  In such instances where no value in the sum is
   entirely missing, the upper (lower) bound is given by the sum of
   any non-missing value and the upper (lower) bound values for values
   given as a range.  When at least one value but fewer than all
   values are missing, only the lower bound is defined for variables
   that must take a positive value.


For all 2009 variables and for the instances of 2007 variables noted
in the preceding discussion, the following codes apply for the (J- and K-)
shadow variables:

0  = Originally reported value.  See above for an exception.?????

1  = Question is inapplicable (e.g., R has no checking account
     so value of checking account is coded as zero.)
     NOTE: all values of zero in the data set are in some sense
     inapplicable [also see J-code value 14]; reported values of zero
     are typically stored as -1.

2  = Data taken from (or moved from) another location in the
     questionnaire; data moved from another location and added
     to data already at the new location; data reported in a "mop-up"
     field that could be directly mapped into the correct final
     location.  These moves and changes may be the result of verbatim
     responses, interviewer comment, or other information.

4  = CAPI program error: resolution yields a non-missing (non-range)
     value.

5  = Indicates a value coded directly by FRB staff from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response or interviewer comments that
     translate directly into a valid response.  This code indicates
     that there was the exercise of a bare minimum of judgment in
     encoding the content of the text data.
6  = Indicates a value coded directly by NORC from a verbatim
     ("other/specify") response.

8  = Variable computed from other non-missing variables.

9  = Variable overridden by logically equivalent information to
     maintain consistency of data.

10 = Part of the original value reported should have been (or was
     also) reported elsewhere and is edited out here.

11 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107/P107 only): value originally
     answered "don't know" or "refuse".
12 = Assumption made in CAPI program to guide questions dependent on
     marital history (applies at X107/P107 and X7020/P7020 only);
     except code 11.  Question not directly asked.

13 = Data changed in editing; based on information in interviewer
     comments made during or after the interview, data structures
     elsewhere in the interview, data retrieval from interviewers, or
     mechanical review of data patterns.  Judgment is implied in the
     use of this code.
14 = Inapplicable code generated by any data adjustment
     (particularly adjustments associated with J-codes 2, 4, 5, 6, 10,
     13, 15, 16, and 17).
15 = Non-stochastic imputation of missing data (typically based at
     least in part on other, non-codable data).
17 = Value of originally missing data item implied by/computed from
     other variable(s).  Relatively more judgement is implied by this
     code than a code 8.

30 = Respondent agreed to provide a dollar range as a response
     (either as a directly volunteered range or in response to the
     question soliciting a range after an initial response or "don't
     know" or "refuse"), but the upper and lower bounds of the range
     given were identical.
31 = Respondent entered the decision tree for dollar values, but chose
     one of the boundary points of a range as the approximate value.

36 = A "don't know" response was given as an answer other than the
     first one to a code-all-that-apply question where the order of
     the responses is taken to matter.  This response is set to blank
     for purposes of data processing.
37 = A "refuse" response was given as an answer other than the
     first one to a code-all-that-apply question where the order of
     the responses is taken to matter.  This response is set to blank
     for purposes of data processing.

ALL RESPONSES THAT FOLLOW HAVE AT LEAST SOME MISSING INFORMATION

90 = Bounding information available based on summary information
     provided by respondent (typically, if a R does not know
     information about items beyond a certain number in a set of
     detailed questions about a larger number of such items, the R is
     asked one or a number of summary questions about all remaining
     instances).
91 = Same as 90, but R gave range data for the summary information.


RANGE RESPONSES:

POSITIVE RANGES

DECISION TREE RESPONSES THAT RESULTED IN A BOUND FOR POSITIVE NUMBERS
Please see the discussion of range responses in the 2007 SCF codebook
for a discussion of the ways that ranges may be generated in the SCF.

(NOTE: for decision tree codes, responses that resulted in no usable
bounding information are collected separately below)

'*' indicates an open-ended interval

NOTE: for J-code outcomes from 101-978, 1021-1040, and 1071-1090, .5 is
added to the J-code if the original response was "don't know".

1200 = R answered DK/REF to main $ question, and refused following
     question requesting a range from the range card (negative amount)
1201 = R answered DK/Ref to main $ question, and refused following
     question requesting type of range (negative amount)

     key) to the following question requesting a range from the range
     card (negative amount)

1304 = Interviewer entered R's initial response as [F9], but R
       subsequently did not provide any range information within
       DOLLARPROBE

OTHER CODES FOR MISSING DATA

2050 = Original response was DK.
2052 = Original response missing as a result of missing information for
     a higher-order question.  For example, if the respondent refused
     to say whether or not the family had a checking account, then the
     number of checking accounts would be missing in this sense.
     In a few circumstances a different procedure is followed: (1) if
     a dollar variable was missing and the answers in DOLLARPROBE
     yielded a missing value that variable has an associated frequency
     question that is only asked when a positive value of the dollar
     variable is reported, then the frequency variable is given the
     same J-code as the dollar variable; (2) for clusters of variables
     containing a dollar amount and percent options (for example,
     employer match rate percentage contribution and dollar amount of
     contribution to a pension plan) that can be computed from each
     other (perhaps given some other variable--in the case of the
     example, this other variable would be the worker's wage).
2053 = Original response was refused
2054 = Original response was "some, DK how many" (see B6).

2056 = Missing value determined from verbatim response by NORC coders.

2060 = Unresolved data problem (none should remain in final data set).

2079 = Data missing because of questionnaire error.
2080 = Recode variable, missing because data not collected for
       sub-group, data to be imputed.
2081 = Recode variable, some, but not all components originally missing.
2082 = Recode variable, all components originally missing.

2097 = Override of reported information with (at least partially)
       imputed data
2098 = Override of reported/inap./other information with a missing value.

2099 = Used for absent spouse for J104 or J105 when X104 or X105 < 0.

3000 = Data missing because R broke off the interview (each of these
       cases reviewed to be sure that sufficient information is
       reported that the case can count as a "partial accepted as
       complete")

3001 = CAPI program error yielding a missing value.

3002 = Temporary value given to variables containing illegal values.
       These will all be resolved in editing and converted to other
       existing codes.  (includes "range U")

3003 = Illegal zero response

3004 = Uninformative/irrelevant verbatim response

3005 = Data not available (applies to data from survey screener)

3500 = Data set to missing and imputed for disclosure avoidance

CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For many purposes it is useful to know which responses were available
to the interviewer and which were actually known by the respondent.
Responses that are noted in the codeframes below by an asterisk are
ones that were available to the interviewer on the screen during the
interview.  In general, if a response is given in the codebook in
lower case letters, this indicates that it was permissible for the
interviewer to read it to the respondent.  Responses listed in all
upper case letters are ones that were not intended to be read to the
respondent.  Codes that result from the recoding of responses
originally reported as "other" are also given in lower case letters.
Other subsidiary question texts given in capital letters are intended
as interviewer instructions.  In some cases, codes were available
conditional on responses to earlier questions.

In some cases, edit checks to support data quality were built directly
into the CAPI program used for collection the SCF data.  All such
edits for the 2009 variables are described under each variable where a
check was made.  Where a corresponding 2007 variable in the panel data
set was defined in terms of a single conceptually equivalent variable,
any edit check on that variable is also noted.  Where a 2007 variable
in the panel data set is defined in terms of multiple variables in the
2007 cross-sectional data set, at least some of which were subjected
to an edit check, a general reference is given to the edit check(s)
described in the 2007 SCF codebook.

For many questions in the SCF there are multiple versions.  Most
commonly, there are variants that are appropriate for single
individuals and ones appropriate for families of two or more.  Some
other variants are more complicated.  For example, as noted earlier, a
small number of variables were pre-loaded into the 2009 panel database
for each interview, where these variable were based on 2007 data; this
information was used in the interview to ask a well framed question
about the status of the property where the household lived at the time
of the 2007 interview.  Of the 3,823 interviews, 39 were conducted in
Spanish.  The Spanish text is not provided in the main section of the
codebook, but the interested user may consult the MR Interview program
on the project website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/
scf_2009documentation.htm.

To allow a consistent form of organization of the data, the variables
and codes associated with the respondent and that person's spouse or
partner (if any) are sometimes rearranged as noted at X8000/P8000.
The term "head" is used in this codebook to refer to the person whose
data are contained in variables (or codes) associated with the
respondent; data for that person's spouse or partner (if any) are
contained in the variables designated for the spouse or partner of the
respondent.  Although the arrangement of the data implies no judgment
whatsoever about the identity of the pricipal decisionmaker or other
such role within the household, the head and the spouse or partner (if
any) are, by sample definition, considered the economic core of the
household.  Because the designation of the head (or spouse/partner) is
made independently for the 2007 and 2009 surveys, there are many
complicated possibilities for the relationship between a 2009 head and
a 2007 head (and similarly for a spouse or partner).  The information
in variables P9002-P9007 describes the relationship between 2007 and
2009 heads and 2007 and 2009 spouses or partners.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCF is a large project that involves intense commitment by many
people.  At the Federal Reserve Board, the main project staff involved
with the creation of the data included Brian Bucks, Gerhard Fries,
Arthur Kennickell (project director and head of the statistical unit),
Traci Mach, Kevin Moore, and Richard Windle.  Important support came
from the FRB officer corps, particularly Diana Hancock.  Under great
time pressure, Mike Kelly, chief of the FRB Procurement Section, and
his staff played an important part in securing the contractual
agreements to execute the survey.

Support from the Statistics of Income Division (SOI) at the IRS has
been critical.  Thomas Petska, director of SOI in 2007 and David Paris
were been essential in negotiating  access to the SOI data needed for
the original 2007 SCF sample design.  Susan Boehmer, SOI director at
the time of the release of the panel, was instrumental in the release
of the data.  Barry Johnson has long been tireless in his work to
facilitate the relationship between the Federal Reserve and SOI and
well as in consulting on the disclosure review for the SCF and in
sharing the insights he has gained in working with the IRS estate tax
data.  Michael Parisi and Adrian Dungan of David Paris' staff were
particularly helpful in gaining approval of the SOI disclosure review
board to release a version of the panel data to the public.

At NORC, very many people have touched the project in important ways.
James Carr, the Project Director, was guided by Catherine Haggerty and
Micah Sjoblom, who were very experienced with the SCF.  Fritz Scheuren
served as the NORC corporate liaison to the SCF.  Chet Bowie and John
Thompson also provided key corporate oversight.  Statistical support
was provided by Steven Pedlow.  A large number of people in the NORC
central office helped with preparation of materials, training,
computer programming, IT support, and various parts of the survey
management; these people include Haider Baig, Suzanne Bard, Valeri
Cooke, Katie DelCiello, Adish Jain, John Kowalisyn, Reshel Kurniadi,
Shannon Nelson, Frank Ochoa, and Geoff Walker. Renee Grigorian served
as the graphic designer for materials used in persuading respondents
to participate.  Logistical support was provided by Albert Bard.

Field operations are the heart of survey research, and a very large
share of the credit for the success of the project goes to the people
involved in that area.  Kyle Fennell and Judith Petty were the NORC
Central Office representatives who coordinated field operations.
Maureen Bonner, Sandra Pitzer and Nina Walker were the field project
managers; their contributions were many, but their strategic insights
into the SCF field work were essential elements of the success of the
project.  The Field Managers were Anne Anderson, Meg Bramwell, Barbara
Burley, Debra Cipriano, Kimberly Courey, Ella Kemp, Charles Losasso,
Nondice McFall, Donna Rader and Pamela Ulbrich.  The interviewers for
the pretest were Anne Anderson, Meg Bramwell, Kim Courey, Charles
Losasso, Nondice McFall, Eileen Mink, Pamela Ulbrich, Nina Walker,
Wendy Wilson and Pat Wollack.  The interviewers for the main field
work, some of whom may prefer not to be named, are always the people
who do the hardest work.  In 2009, the field team included many
experienced interviewers--some who had worked on earlier SCFs--and
others from a wide variety of backgrounds.  They deserve the deep
gratitude of users of the SCF data.  We humbly apologize to many other
colleagues in the Central Office and in the field who worked on the
2007 SCF and whose names do not appear here through oversight.

The largest debt is owed to the survey respondents, who are
necessarily anonymous.  May every user of the data remember that some
person gave his or her time in the public interest to create the data
that make their analysis possible.

No set of acknowledgements would be complete without mentioning three
people: Fritz Scheuren, who provided early and continuing
encouragement, insights, and support for the SCF project; Robert
Avery, the first director of the SCF, who not only created the
atmosphere that made the current development of the project possible,
but who continues to contribute as a sounding board for new ideas; and
Dorothy S. Projector, the project director of the Federal Reserve's
landmark 1962-63 Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers, set
a very high standard for all future work on household wealth surveys.

          The weights for the panel were computed for the subset of
          cases that participated in the 2009 interview with
          allowance made for cases out of scope in 2009.  Thus, the
          sum of the weights is equal to the number of households in
          the population in 2009 less the estimated number of
          households that dissolved between 2007 and 2009 due to death
          or immigration.  For estimates based on the 2007 or 2009 (or
          both) data sets, users should employ one of the panel
          weights (P42000 or P42001) below.

P42000	  Original Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight.


P42001    Revised Kennickell-Woodburn consistent weight: accounts for
          systematic deviations from CPS estimates of homeownership
          by racial/ethnic Groups.  This weight should be used for all
          estimations using the final 2007-2009 panel data for which
          weights are appropriate.

           The variables listed in this section were derived from
           variables in the 2007 SCF.  This information we pre-loaded
           into the database used during the interview and it was used
           to identify the home the survey household lived in at the
           time of the 2007 interview and to flag the existence of a
           personal business.

           THIS STATEMENT MUST BE READ TO ALL RESPONDENTS:

           This interview is completely voluntary and confidential,
           and all the information collected will be used for
           statistical purposes only.  Because this interview is a
           part of the Survey of Consumer Finances, I will be asking a
           number of questions that have dollar answers.  The most
           useful answer is always an exact amount that truly reflects
           your situation.  However, this is not always possible--you
           may not know the figure, or you may not feel comfortable
           answering.  Because your answers are so important to the
           study, I am allowed to collect dollar ranges when no better
           information is available.  Of course, if there is a
           question you cannot answer or do not want to answer, we
           will move on at that point.  Feel free to consult any
           knowledgeable person or use any records and notes at any
           time during this interview.  And please ask questions
           when anything is not clear.  The interview will take about
           an hour to complete. If you have questions about your
           rights as a research participant, please contact Kathleen
           Parks at NORC at 866-309-0542.

           In the 2007 SCF, the definitions used in determining
           whether a spouse or partner is a part of the primary
           economic unit changed somewhat from earlier SCFs.  Most of
           these changes affect small groups of the population.  Two
           groups account for most of the changes.  First, cases where
           the respondent initially reports being married, but the
           spouse is not there (or it is questionable whether the
           spouse is there) and does not share in the finances of the
           unit (or it is questionable whether the spouse does so).
           The second group is a roughly comparable group of partners.
           Where respondents have not been willing to answer questions
           about the presence of spouses or partner, default
           assumptions were made.

P7019      Recode: The following variable summarizes the sets of
           possible martial arrangements and specifies the assumption
           about whether a spouse or partner is included in the
           primary economic unit.  The information used in this
           classification is based on the answers of the original
           respondent; when P8000=5, this information is contained in
           the first position of the household listing variables
           below, and when P8000=1 the information in the second
           position was used.  Note that unlike the case with other
           variables in the main interview, variables in the initial
           household listing describing the respondent's marital
           status are not imputed.

           IN THE CAPI PROGRAM USED IN THE SURVEY, DESIGNATED Rs

           OR P6107/P7382/P6108 DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF P8000).
           THE COMPUTER CALCULATED THEIR AGE AND THEN THE INTERVIEWER
           ASKED FOR CONFIRMATION (P7005/P7015).  AT THAT POINT, 
           A RESPONDENT COULD AGREE TO THE COMPUTED AGE, CORRECT THEIR
           BIRTH DATE, OR PROVIDE A DIFFERENT AGE (P8022/P104).  
           FOR THE DESIGNATED R, THIS VARIABLE CONTAINS THE DOB AGE UNLESS

SECTION D: PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

           NOTE: For households that owned their principal residence
           in 2007, the panel questionnaire was designed to track that
           home, regardless of whether it was the principal residence
           of the household in 2009.  Where the household continued to
           own the 2007 residence, only the current value (P09305) and
           current mortgage information were asked.  For purposes of
           the final research version of the panel data set, more
           detailed information about the home was mapped into the
           panel variables in the range P501-P7135.  Where the
           household no longer owned the 2007 residence, the variables
           in the range P501-P7135 contain information about the new
           home.

           To minimize complications in the development of the CAPI
           program, some outcomes that were judged to be sufficiently
           rare were not explored in detail:
           (1) Owners in 2007 who still owned that home in 2009 but
           whose primary residence in 2009 was rented were not asked
           the date they moved and rent and associated questions about
           their new home.  They were, however, asked for current
           value and mortgage information on the 2007 residence.
           (2) Owners in 2007 and 2009 who still owned the 2007 home,
           but whose main residence in 2009 was a different property
           (a new property or one reported in Section E in 2007) were
           not asked when they moved into their 2009 home.  Imputation
           or information from interviewer comments was used to fill
           in these missing data.  (See P09368-P09873 and P09832-P09833.)

X601	   QUESTION TEXT SAME AS 2009 VERSION

P601       Now I have some questions about your home.  Do you (or your family 
	   living here) own  both this mobile home and site or lot, do you 
	   own only the mobile home, do you own only the site, do you rent 
	   both the home and site, or another arrangement?

           IF THE PROPERTY IS OWNED THROUGH A TRUST THE PEU SET UP,
           TREAT IT AS OWNED BY THEM.

            1.  *Own both home and site --> GO TO P623
            2.  *Own only site --> GO TO P602
            3.  *Own only home --> GO TO P612
            4.  *Rent both --> GO TO P619
           -7.  *Neither own nor rent --> GO TO P609

           you own it as a part of a condo, co-op, townhouse
           association, or something else?

           IF THE PROPERTY IS OWNED THROUGH A TRUST THE PEU SET UP,

           ATTENTION:
           Homeownership is a critical detail in family finances.
           Without this information, it would be wasting your time to
           go on with the interview.

           I will terminate the interview at this point and I would
           like to thank you for your time.

SECTION E: OTHER REAL ESTATE

           In 2007, up to three properties other than the principal
           residence were asked about individually; any remaining
           properties were classified into vacation homes or other
           investment real estate.  For purposes of constructing
           variables as closely equivalent to the panel variables as
           possible, properties asked about individually in 2007 were
           classified into the panel categories using information on
           the type of each property (X1703/1803/1902).

           have through a current or past job.

           accounts.  These may include accounts that you "rolled
           over" into an IRA after leaving a previous job as well as
           Roth IRAs, or any other type of IRA or Keogh account that
           is not part of a retirement plan on a current or past job.

           Do you (or anyone in your family living here) have any
           Keoghs or IRAs?

           IF YES, SAY: Please do not include IRA-SEP or IRA-SIMPLE accounts,

P4001      Do you (or anyone in your family living here) have any life
           insurance?  Please include individual and group policies,
           but not accident insurance.

X4002	   QUESTION TEXT SAME AS 2009 VERSION

P4002      The two major types of life insurance are term and
           cash-value policies.  Term policies pay a benefit if the
           insured person dies, but otherwise have no value.  They are
           often provided through an employer or union, but may also
           be bought by individuals.  Cash-value policies also pay a
           death benefit, but differ in that they build up a value as
           premiums are paid.

           Are any of your (family's) policies term insurance?

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working fewer than 20 hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
           if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
           occupation.

	   There are two general types of pension plans.	

	   In one type, a worker is entitled to receive regular
           retirement payments for as long as the worker lives, which
           are most often determined by a formula as a percentage of
           final or average pay.

           In the other type of plan, money accumulates in an account
           designated for the worker, such as a 401(k), and that money 
	   may be paid out in a variety of ways depending on the plan 
	   or the worker's choice.

           Some plans may be like both of these types.

           Is there any type of account balance associated with 
	   ([your/his/her] plans/any of [your/his/her] pension plans)?

           For each occupation group, regressions were run separately
           for males and females of the log of annualized wages on a
           constant, a spline on age (AGE, MAX(0, AGE-35),
           MAX(0,AGE-55)), a dummy variable for part-time employment
           (1 = working 20 or fewer hours per week), a dummy variable
           for self-employment (1 = self-employed), a dummy for race
           (1 = Hispanic or non-white), and dummy variables for years
           of education (1 = : 12 years of education, some college or
           an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, higher degree
           than Bachelor's degree).  If there were too few people in a CPS
           3-digit occupation group, either the SCF case was matched to
           a neighboring occupation group, or the match was made at the
           level of the 2-digit occupation code.  Some of the model
           coefficients may be identically zero where there are too few
           cases in the appropriate cells in the CPS data to identify
           these coefficients; for example, a coefficient for the
           [36,55) element of the age spline may be identically zero
           if there are no CPS cases in that age group for the given
           occupation.

CURRENT OR FUTURE PENSION BENEFITS OTHER THAN SOCIAL SECURITY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
           In 2007, the household was asked separately about pensions
           for which benefits were currently being received and any
           aside from possible benefits on a current job from which 
           benefits were expected in the future.  In 2009, the
           household was asked about both types together.

P091126    There are two general types of pension plans.

           In one type, a worker is entitled to receive regular
           retirement payments for as long as the worker lives, which
           are most often determined by a formula as a percentage of
           final or average pay.

           In the other type of plan, money accumulates in an account
           designated for the worker, such as a 401(k), and that money may be
           paid out in a variety of ways depending on the plan or the worker's
           choice.

           Some plans may be like both of these types.

	   received in 2008 [in 2007: 2006] from all sources, before taxes 
	   and other deductions were made?

           X/P7362 that was higher (lower).  These cases appear to be
           ones where the frame of reference for "normal" has shifted:
           e.g., a student made an unusually large amount last year as
           a student, but in a full-time job now makes more.

HEALTH INSURANCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

           In the 2007 survey, questions asked separately about
           publicly provided and private health insurance.  In 2009,
           the initial question about coverage (P091312) included both
           types of plan, but the types were distinguished by the
           questions that followed.

           "your family" as we have gone through the interview.)
